Week 4 Progress (Ending Nov 30):

Week 4 was dedicated to generating preliminary results and refining our models. We improved the lateral inhibition mechanism by designing a Gaussian-based inhibition mask to more closely replicate biological center-surround behavior. This improved model stability during training.

We ran full training sessions for both models. The Modern CNN achieved approximately 98% test accuracy on MNIST, while the Neocognitron-inspired model achieved strong performance as well, around 97–98%, depending on hyperparameters. We tuned batch size, learning rate, and weight initialization to improve consistency across runs.

We implemented the evaluation pipeline in eval.py, including:

generating the confusion matrix

visualizing sample predictions

exporting prediction images

confirming the best_model.pth loads correctly

We added the training_loss_curve.png and training_accuracy_curve.png files to the results/ folder and updated the README to include final training and evaluation instructions.

Week 4 delivered the first complete set of preliminary results and validated that both models trained and generalized successfully.
