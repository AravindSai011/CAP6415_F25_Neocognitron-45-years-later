Week 4 Progress (Ending Nov 30):During Week 4, we focused on training the model, generating preliminary results, and creating visualizations required for analysis.Model Training* Completed the full training loop implementation.* Added validation monitoring and model checkpoint saving.* Trained the Neocognitron-style model for several epochs on MNIST.* Achieved strong initial accuracy, confirming stable learning performance.Evaluation & Demo Development* Finalized the evaluation script for testing on the MNIST test set.* Implemented the demo script to generate predicted images with labels.* Saved demo outputs in the results/demo/ directory for documentation and final presentation.Visualization Work* Generated training curves (accuracy and loss) and saved them under results/graphs/.* Extracted feature maps from S-layers and C-layers using the extended forward method.* Stored visualizations in results/feature_maps/, showing hierarchical feature extraction patterns.Translation-Invariance Experiment* Performed a translation experiment by shifting digits and analyzing output stability.* Produced heatmaps demonstrating improved positional robustness in deeper C-layers.* Saved results under results/invariance/, supporting the theoretical motivation of the Neocognitron.Documentation Updates* Updated the README with a clean abstract, usage instructions, and folder structure.* Ensured that the repository met reproducibility and clarity requirements.SummaryBy the end of Week 4, the team completed model training, produced key experimental results, created visualizations, and documented the project structure. The project is now ready for Week 5 activities, including final experiments and video demo preparation.
