Week 3 Progress (Ending Nov 23):
In Week 3, our primary focus was implementing both model architectures. We started by coding the Modern CNN baseline in model.py. This model included convolutional layers, batch normalization, pooling, and fully connected layers. We tested it through the training script and ensured that the forward and backward passes executed correctly.

Next, we implemented the Neocognitron-inspired S-cell and C-cell layers. For S-cells, we used a learnable excitatory convolution followed by a fixed surround-inhibition kernel to simulate biological lateral inhibition. For C-cells, we used max pooling to mirror the spatial tolerance described in Fukushima’s design. We assembled these layers into a working hierarchical model.

Debugging was a significant part of this week. We encountered issues with inconsistent tensor shapes, incorrect broadcasting of the inhibition filters, and activation scaling. After resolving these problems, we were able to run the first successful forward passes and preliminary training runs.

Additionally, we implemented plotting utilities for visualizing training curves and prepared the results/ directory to store output images. Week 3 marked an important milestone where both the baseline and Neocognitron-style models became functional.
