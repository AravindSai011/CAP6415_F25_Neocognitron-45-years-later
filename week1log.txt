Week 1 Development Log  
Course: CAP6415  
  

1. Project Topic Selection
   During Week 1, I selected my final project topic based on the 1980 paper 
   “Neocognitron: A Self-organizing Neural Network Model for a Mechanism of 
   Pattern Recognition Unaffected by Shift in Position” by Kunihiko Fukushima. 
   This paper is notable for introducing the early architectural concepts 
   that later inspired Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
   The project goal is to study, understand, and reimplement the Neocognitron 
   using modern tools while demonstrating its position-invariant recognition 
   capability and comparing it to contemporary CNNs.

2. Paper Study and Technical Review
   I downloaded the original paper and began a detailed reading, 
   focusing on understanding:
     • The hierarchical S-layers and C-layers that mimic simple and complex cells.
     • The concept of cell-planes and how each plane extracts a specific feature.
     • Unsupervised "learning without a teacher," which drives self-organization.
     • Mathematical formulations of S-cell outputs, C-cell outputs, inhibition, 
       and receptive fields.
     • The reinforcement rule governing how modifiable synapses evolve.
     • How the neocognitron achieves position invariance.
   I took structured notes identifying each mathematical component required 
   for implementation and mapped them to possible PyTorch equivalents.

3. Initial Implementation Planning
   I drafted the high-level structure for the implementation:
     • A modular architecture to represent U0 → S1 → C1 → S2 → C2 → S3 → C3.
     • Classes for S-layer modules and C-layer modules.
     • Structures to store modifiable synapses (trainable parameters) 
       and unmodifiable synapses (fixed kernels).
     • A training loop for unsupervised self-organization.
   I also analyzed how to handle:
     • r.m.s.-type inhibitory cells,
     • lateral inhibition,
     • feature extraction within planes,
     • representative cell selection during learning.
  4. Repository Setup
   I created a public GitHub repository following project instructions with the 
   exact format:
       CAP6415_F25_project-Neocognitron
   Inside the repository, I initialized:
     • A README.md that includes the project title, objective, and overview.
