Week 1 focused on establishing the foundation for our project. We began by reviewing the project guidelines and understanding the required timeline, deliverables, and expectations. We created the public GitHub repository named “CAP6415_F25_Neocognitron-45-years-later” and organized it with the proper initial structure, including the src/ folder, results/ folder, and weekly log files.

We studied Fukushima’s original 1980 Neocognitron paper to understand the biological concepts behind S-cells, C-cells, and hierarchical feature extraction. We reviewed additional online resources and modern interpretations to better connect the Neocognitron to current computer vision techniques.

On the technical side, we set up our development environment using Python, PyTorch, and VS Code. We confirmed that our environment could download and load MNIST, and we prepared the initial outline of the README.md file. We also created a clear roadmap for the project: implementing a modern CNN baseline and a Neocognitron-inspired model with lateral inhibition and comparing their results.

Overall, Week 1 focused on research, planning, environment setup, and repository preparation.
