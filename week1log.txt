Week 1 Development Log
Course: CAP6415
1. Selection of Project Topic
In Week 1, I chose a topic for my final project based on the 1980 paper
“Neocognitron: A Self-organizing Neural Network Model for a Mechanism of
“Pattern Recognition Unaffected by Shift in Position” by Kunihiko Fukushima.
This paper is remarkable since it introduces the early architectural concepts.
That later inspired Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The aim of the project is to study, understand, and re-implement the Neocognitron.
using modern tools while demonstrating its position-invariant recognition.
capability, and comparing it to contemporary CNNs.

2. Paper Study and Technical Review
I downloaded the original paper and began a detailed reading.
focusing on understanding:
• The hierarchical S- and C-layers that mimic simple and complex cells.
• Cell-planes: The idea of this concept is that each plane extracts a different feature.
• Unsupervised, "learning without a teacher," driving self-organization.
• Mathematical formulations of S-cell outputs, C-cell outputs, inhibition,
and receptive fields.
• The reinforcement rule governing how modifiable synapses evolve.
How the neocognitron achieves position invariance.
I took structured notes, identifying each mathematical component required.

implementation, and mapped them onto possible PyTorch equivalents.
3. Initial Implementation Planning
I drafted the high-level structure for the implementation:
• A modular architecture representing U0 → S1 → C1 → S2 → C2 → S3 → C3.
• Classes for S-layer modules and C-layer modules.
• Data structures for storing modifiable synapses, i.e., trainable parameters
and unmodifiable synapses (fixed kernels).
• A training loop for unsupervised self-organization.
I also analyzed how to handle:
• r.m.s.-type inhibitory cells,
• lateral inhibition,
• feature extraction within planes,
• representative cell selection during learning.
4. Setting Up the Repository
I created a public GitHub repository following project instructions with the
exact format:
CAP6415_F25_project-Neocognitron
Inside the repository, I initialized: • A README.md that includes project title, objective and overview.
