Week 1 Log (Ending November 9)

This week focused on setting up the foundation for the entire course project. After reviewing the project guidelines, I created the public GitHub repository “CAP6415_F25_Neocognitron-45-years-later” and verified that it displays correctly in a clean, organized structure. I added an initial README.md along with empty directories for src/, results/, and logs, preparing the structure that the final project will follow.

I studied the original paper by Fukushima (1980) to understand the biological principles behind the Neocognitron, including S-cells, C-cells, and the concept of hierarchical feature extraction. I also reviewed secondary resources explaining the architecture to better plan how to reconstruct the model using modern computer vision tools.

On the engineering side, I set up my working environment using Python 3.10, PyTorch, and VS Code. I tested GPU/CPU availability and installed all required packages. I drafted the first version of the project description and clarified which components needed to be implemented from scratch.

Finally, I outlined the model roadmap: (1) implement a simple baseline CNN, (2) implement the Neocognitron-inspired S/C-layer architecture, (3) train both models on MNIST, (4) generate results and comparisons. This week was primarily research, planning, and repository preparation.
